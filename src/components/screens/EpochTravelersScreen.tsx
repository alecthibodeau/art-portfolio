          The bones of an extinct mastodon surfaced during a 19th century dredging by New York City workers at <a href={baisleyPondLink}>Baisley Pond</a> in the City's Queens borough.
          This mastodon had roamed the Pleistocene landscape, shaping its habitat while browsing for honey locust seed pods and socializing
          with other members of its group. <span className="fst-italic">Epoch Travelers</span> depicts an imagined version of this animal at life size and accompanied by honey locust branches.
          The artwork is permanently installed at a public school in the St. Albans neighborhood of Queens &mdash; just a few miles away from Baisley Pond &mdash; as a tribute to the area's former ecosystem.
